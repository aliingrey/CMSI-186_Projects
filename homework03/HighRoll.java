/*

You will need to have a main that constructs the dice set, has rolls, and displays scores from each roll. 

The rules are as follows:

Implement a Textual User Interface (TUI) on the command line. 
This will display a list of options to the user, and will prompt for input. 
Based on that input your program will do what the user selected, then will display the results, a blank line or two, and then re-display the options.

Option 1 in the list must be: ROLL ALL THE DICE
Option 2 in the list must be: ROLL A SINGLE DIE
Option 3 in the list must be: CALCULATE THE SCORE FOR THIS SET
Option 4 in the list must be: SAVE THIS SCORE AS HIGH SCORE
Option 5 in the list must be: DISPLAY THE HIGH SCORE
Option 6 in the list must be: ENTER 'Q' TO QUIT THE PROGRAM

                  * For option 2, you may present a second prompt to get the number of the die to roll, 
                  * or you may handle it as two numbers on the entry. 
                  An example of the first method would be to enter a '2' at the prompt, 
                  then display a new prompt such as "which die?" and read the user input. 
                  An example of the second method would be to read "2 5" to re-roll only die number 5; 
                  this method means you must parse the input to get the die index.
                  To run the program, you can do one of two things: EITHER start the program using...
                  java HighRoll <number of dice> <number of sides> â€¦OR
                    java HighRoll and prompt the user for the parameters.
